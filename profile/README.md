# Welcome to The Perl + Alien Project

The Perl Alien project is dedicated to creating external non-Perl dependencies for CPAN.
The project is centered around the `Alien::Build` ecosystem, and if you are interested
in Perl Aliens then the best place to start is one of these two documents depending on
if you want to create or use an Alien:

 * [Alien::Build::Manual::AlienAuthor](https://alienfile.org/pod/Alien/Build/Manual/AlienAuthor.html) - for would be authors of new Aliens
 * [Alien::Build::Manual::AlienUser](https://alienfile.org/pod/Alien/Build/Manual/AlienUser.html) - for users of Aliens

If you are curious about the rationale for the Alien concept or curious about its history, check out the original manifesto:

 * [Alien](https://alienfile.org/pod/Alien.html) - the original manifesto

If you need help with Aliens as either a user or an author, you can ask ad-hoc questions
on our IRC channel, which is [#native on irc.perl.org](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.perl.org/#native?nick=mc-guest-?) (you can click
on the link to access the channel in your browser if you do not otherwise have an IRC client handy).  (You may want to check out
[the project FAQ](https://alienfile.org/pod/Alien/Build/Manual/FAQ.html) to save yourself some time if you have a common question).
If you have specific issues or PRs that
you want to make against modules in the `Alien::Build` ecosystem, then please do make them against the appropriate GitHub repositories in
this org.

We also have a website for the project at [alienfile.org](https://alienfile.org).  It includes a comprehensive set of documentation
for all CPAN modules managed by the project, and a blog where new features are discussed periodically.  The project's official Twitter account is
[@AlienPerl](https://twitter.com/AlienPerl)

Thanks!
